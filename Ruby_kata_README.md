Group Kata

Then an array called group containing the two hashes is created

Movies Kata

The code creates 4 separate hashes. Then a new array containing the hashes is created. Finally, the "each" method iterates through the array and "puts" the years values.

Name Kata

The ".chomp" method is used to collect and store the first and last name in "firstname" and "lastname" respectively. There after, their values are "put" on the screen

Arrays Kata

The code is supposed to iterate through an array of numbers called "arr". If the array contains a "num" that is equal to the variable "number, then the code puts "#{number} is in the array." But, the code is not working. I suspect that this is because no array is created and that no input is taken from the user to compare with the values in the array. |num| is a variable that is used to store the values in the array. "==" is used to check if the "if" statement is true.

Nested arrays

arr[1][0] are entered to identify the values in the two dimensional array. The first digit signifies the array in the first dimension. The second digit signifies the second dimension.
